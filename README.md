### Hi, my name is Rodney Blevins and I'm a fullstack web developer ðŸ‘‹

I first started coding PHP in 1997 (which is approximately 100 years ago in internet years :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and I never looked back. Up until about 5 years ago, I mostly worked on WordPress sites for various organizations around the globe. In the past 5 years I have mostly been building SaaS webapps using Vue.js on the frontend and a PHP API.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on highly available SaaS webapps with [Connected Data Solutions](https://connecteddatasolutions.com/flightdeck.php)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about adding an API, authentication, storage, etc to a project using AWS Amplify
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the JavaScript framework I'm developing called [Simpel.js](https://github.com/reblevins/simpel.js)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: rodney@rodneyblevins.dev
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am married to a Dutch lady and we lived in Europe for 16 years. I've lived in 5 different countries and I've visited more than 14 countries spread across 5 different continents. We have two beautiful daughters.
