### Hi, my name is Rodney Blevins and I'm a fullstack software engineer ðŸ‘‹

I first started coding PHP in 1997 (which is approximately 100 years ago in internet years :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and I never looked back. Up until about 2015, I mostly worked on WordPress sites for various organizations around the globe. Since then I have mostly been building SaaS webapps using various technologies and frameworks such as Vue.js, Ruby on Rails, Python Flask, Node.js and PHP.

- ðŸ”­ Most recently I have been working on highly available SaaS webapps with [Relevize](https://relevize.com)
- ðŸŒ± I have been learning: Python, Flask, Authentication with Auth0, Sqlalchemy, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) (for E2E testing), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) (a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation), and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am married to a Dutch lady and we lived in Europe for 16 years. I've lived in 5 different countries and I've visited more than 14 countries spread across 5 different continents. We have two beautiful daughters.
